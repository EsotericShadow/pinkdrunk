# PinkDrunk Planning Index

## Purpose
This workspace holds all pre-build artefacts required before writing production code: product definition, research backlog, technical architecture, data design, and brand experience.

## Directory Map
- `00-overview/` — product mission, goals, and positioning snapshots.
- `01-research/` — outstanding questions, research plans, and insights log.
- `02-tech-architecture/` — stack decisions, infrastructure, and integration diagrams.
- `03-data-design/` — schemas, data flows, and ML feature definitions.
- `04-ux-brand/` — UX flows, IA, voice, and visual language.

## Next Steps
- Populate each section with ongoing discoveries as they emerge.
- Treat this directory as the single source of truth during pre-production.
- Update meta descriptions when new subdirectories are added.
